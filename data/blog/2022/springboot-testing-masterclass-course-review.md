Java has been one of the oldest and most widely used programming languages. Many of our server-side applications are written using Java and Spring Boot.

To keep these applications up and running and evolve them reliably without breaking any existing requirements, we need to write “Tests”

Now, when we think about writing tests in Java, we sometimes have some concerns.

- Where do we start? Unit tests, integration tests, component tests?
- Are we writing the tests correctly?
- Can we rely on the tests we write?
- Are we using the right testing libraries?

Hence there is always this notion of delivering features without writing tests.

But this does not serve us well when we add new features to our application or make some breaking changes. Even if the tests are written but are not reliable, they serve no value to us.

There is a famous saying.

**_“Unreliable tests are the same as having no tests at all”._**

We can always search on the internet for resources on how to write good and reliable tests.

**_But what if we can find it all in one place?_**

This is where I would like to introduce you to the “[Testing Spring Boot Application Masterclass](https://transactions.sendowl.com/stores/13745/235788)” by [Philip Riecks](https://twitter.com/rieckpil).

This course provides you with a comprehensive guide on how you can start and grow your knowledge on writing effective tests for your Spring Boot application.

Here are the some of features of this course

- A step-by-step guide starting from basic to advance features.
- Real-world code testing, no hello world examples.
- Understanding clear differences between various testing libraries.
- The course also gives in-depth knowledge about the various testing options. Such as how he explains how to use `TestEntityManger` during JPA tests.
- Code walkthrough before testing the code helps to set the context and brings in new knowledge.
- At the end of each chapter, there is a short review to brush up on the concepts that we learn which are really helpful.
- Most importantly if you have any questions, you can always reach out to Philip

Some of the things I learned from this course are

- Testing asynchronous handlers, such as consuming messages.
- Creating custom application slices for testing various application slices.
- End-to-end test with Selenide with the Testcontainers WebDriver module.

Go ahead and explore the [course](https://transactions.sendowl.com/stores/13745/235788) to become better at writing tests and advance your career in the world of Java and Spring Boot.

I keep exploring and learning new things. If you want to know the latest trends and improve your software development skills, then subscribe to my newsletter below and also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/amrutprabhu42).
