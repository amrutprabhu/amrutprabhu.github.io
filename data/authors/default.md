Hi there,

I am Amrut, a software engineer, and I am running this blog.

I like to explore various topics in tech and learning something new excites me. I have a lot of experience in Java and Spring Boot and also like to dig into setting up software infrastructure. I am a huge fan of working with Kubernetes and cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, etc.

Currently, I am working as a Staff Engineer at a German fintech, and in my own time, I learn new things, try them out, and now I have started to write about them.

If you want to get in touch with me or have any feedback about my writing, don’t hesitate to contact me at

Follow me on Twitter to learn more about how to become a better software developer.
