Hi there,

I am Amrut, a software engineer and I am running this blog.

I like to explore various topics in tech and learning something new excites me. I have a lot of experience in Java and Spring Boot and also like to dig into setting up software infrastructure. I am a huge fan of working with Kubernetes and cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, etc.

Currently, I am working as a Tech Lead at a German fintech and in my leisure time, I learn new things, try them out, and write about them to enlighten everyone.

If you want to get in touch with me or have any feedback about my writing, donâ€™t hesitate to contact me.
